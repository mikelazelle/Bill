style='font-size:15'>This site has been created to provide a meeting place for liver transplant patients. The website name “toliverdie.com” is not only a play on words, but it is also a choice we all have made TO LIVE OR DIE. We are building a community of compassionate caring individuals that have had liver transplants, hopefully enriching each other’s lives. There are regularly scheduled meetings where community members share camaraderie, support, information, and experiences with their peers. There are no roll call or attendance requirements, we do hope that if you request a spot at a meeting that you do attend. There is no charge or fee (although contributions are always welcome) to attend meetings. To attend meetings, you will need to become a member of the community. To become a member of this community you will need to submit a valid email address. Invitations to scheduled meetings are sent by request only because there is limited space available. Only community members will be invited to scheduled meetings.</p>
